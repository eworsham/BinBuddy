# Overview

This iOS app is an inventory management app called BinBuddy. The app is for people who have physical storage spaces in their homes or offices. The app will allow for setting up containers and storing items in those containers to mirror the storage of the physical space. The app can then be used to recall where items were stored, eliminating the need to physically search through all the containers in the home or office storage space to find what the user is looking for.

# Development Environment
* Developed in Xcode
* Written in Swift and SwiftUI

# Useful Websites
* [Apple's Swift Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/)
* [Apple's SwiftUI Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI)

# Future Work
* A bug that I need to fix is that you can add containers and items with empty names. I would like to validate the input from the user so that empty names are not allowed
* A feature that I would like to add is the ability to edit the name of containers and items
* One enhacement for the app that I want to implement is the ability to scan a QR code that is tied to a container. Users would be able to print out a QR code and place it on a container, scaning that QR code in the app would open up the contents of that container in the app
